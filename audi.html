		<p>Audi AG is a German automotive manufacturer of luxury vehicles headquartered in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany. A subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group, Audi produces vehicles in nine production facilities worldwide.
		The origins of the company are complex, dating back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer August Horch. Two other manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer) also contributed to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932. The modern Audi era began in the 1960s, when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz.After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus creating the present-day form of the company.

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>August Horch founded the Audi company in Zwickau, Germany, after leaving his previous company, A. Horch & Cie. The name "Audi" is derived from the Latin translation of his surname, which means "to listen." The first Audi automobile, the Audi Type A, was produced, marking the beginning of the brand's legacy.<br/>
		Audi merged with three other automakers—Horch, DKW, and Wanderer—to form the Auto Union. The four interlinked rings of the Audi logo represent this alliance.During this period, Audi gained recognition for its innovative engineering and successful racing vehicles, including the Auto Union Grand Prix cars.<br/>
		After World War II, the company faced challenges due to destruction and a lack of resources. It eventually resumed production, focusing on smaller, affordable cars.Audi became part of the Volkswagen Group, which provided the necessary support for expansion and modernization.<br/>
		The Audi 100, launched in 1968, was a breakthrough model, known for its aerodynamic design and fuel efficiency. It set the stage for Audi’s reputation in the premium car segment.
		Audi introduced the Quattro, an all-wheel-drive system that revolutionized the automotive industry and dominated rally racing, enhancing the brand’s performance credentials.<br/>
		Audi expanded its lineup with models like the A3, A4, A6, and the luxury A8, which showcased advanced technology and luxury features. The brand gained significant market share in Europe and North America.
		Audi established its luxury SUV line with the Q7, followed by the Q5 and Q3, tapping into the growing SUV market.<br/>
		Audi has focused on sustainability and electric mobility, introducing the e-tron series of electric vehicles. The brand continues to emphasize innovation in design, technology, and performance.
